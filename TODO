- Make a web UI
	Controls:
		Start - Start server
		Stop - Stop Server
		Restart - Restart server
		Update & Restart - Restarts your server, updates your mods & deletes their old workshop folders to replace it with the new mod.
		(also would be nice if it detected maps to copy and paste to the servers map folder so there's no issues too but it's okay if not)

	File manager
	Config file editor
	Permissions manager
		Add user 
		Delete user
		Set permissions

	Console Viewer
	Console message server
	Dedicated memory setup
	Filter catch logs (such as hacks for quick grabbing ability)
