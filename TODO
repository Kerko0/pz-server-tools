- Fix infinite loop when running pzupdate from cron and pzstart was not run yet
	Possible fix: Move first time logic from pzstart to pzinstall?
- Fix bug in pzstinstall with pzst_config user not being able to create home folder of pzst (it's not meant to happen)
- Implement new commands softreset and hardreset
- Switch to user crontab when appropriate
- Add hook system to execute scripts on server restart
- Fix pzstenv: Add more checks to ensure we get the correct path to REPO
- Remove user from config.json in case we detect there's no pzserver installed for that user
- Add restore save backup
- Add commands pause/unpause to pause the game
- Stop pzserver before pzuninstall
- Stop all pzserver before bin/uninstall
- Monitor memory and trigger reboot if needed
- Prevent new pzservers to use any port in the port range of other pzservers
- Fix pzcommand
	Check all commands are working
	Show error message if command is invalid or unknown
- Troubleshing
	Error! app state is 0x202 after update job (out of space)
- Make a web UI
	Controls:
		Start - Start server
		Stop - Stop Server
		Restart - Restart server
		Update & Restart - Restarts your server, updates your mods & deletes their old workshop folders to replace it with the new mod.
		(also would be nice if it detected maps to copy and paste to the servers map folder so there's no issues too but it's okay if not)

	File manager
	Config file editor
	Permissions manager
		Add user 
		Delete user
		Set permissions

	Console Viewer
	Console message server
	Dedicated memory setup
	Filter catch logs (such as hacks for quick grabbing ability)

	Extra:
		big servers have bad zombie issues and the zpop files should be deleted here and there... for resource issues this helps alot after testing.
